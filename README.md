Open Educational Resources (OERs) are freely accessible content useful for teaching, learning and research.
They have revolutionized the way we learn by making a plethora of learning opportunities freely available to anyone with an internet connection.

Pocket OER2GO is an Android Application which contains all the OERs present on the World Possible website.This app was created for World Possible Hackathon 2018.Pocket OER2GO works without internet connection and it can be used for the four billion of the worldâ€™s population which lacks access to the internet and is unaware of the resources like  Wikipedia and Khan Academy. This will leads to an immense widening of the knowledge gap.
